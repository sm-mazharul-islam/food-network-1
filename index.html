            <p class="blog">We achieved independence about twently year ago. British people ruled this coundtry
                for about two hundred
                years. It became independent in 1971 in name but not in reality. The Pakistan Government neglected the
                economy of the then East Pakistan. This land was the home land of raw-materials but adequate measures
                had not been taken to improve the agriculture,industry and commerce of our country Nothing was done to
                carry to carry out its development.</p>

                <p>There's no such thing as too much chocolate. Just ask your friends after making brownie lasagna, or
                    Oreogasm poke cake, or the amazingly delicious salted caramel brownies. Moral of the story: When you
                    need a good bite of something chocolatey, these cookies, brownies, and cakes will most certainly do
                    the trick.</p>
